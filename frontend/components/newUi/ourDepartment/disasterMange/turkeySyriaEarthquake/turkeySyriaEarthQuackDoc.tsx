          `Our comprehensive assistance included cooked food, container houses,
        ration parcels, cash aid, and essential supplies for the needy. But our
        commitment didn't end there. FGRF made a promise to the orphans and
        widows affected by the disasters: to provide them with homes. Today,
        we're proud to announce that we've partnered with Turkey's official
        Disaster Management Department to construct 100 houses and 2 schools in
        the border areas of Turkey and Syria, providing shelter and education to
        those in need. And that's not allâ€”FGRF has signed agreements with
        Turkish officials for the construction of over 200 additional houses and
        schools, furthering our mission to empower communities and rebuild
        lives. Join us in making a difference. Explore FGRF's efforts and learn
        how you can support our ongoing initiatives on our website.`}
