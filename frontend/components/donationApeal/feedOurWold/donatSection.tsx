            <p className="text-base text-center pt-8 py-3">Worldwide, there are more than 690 million people who suffer from chronic hunger. Extreme food insecurity brought on by severe poverty will mean these people might go days without eating.</p>
            <p className="text-base text-center py-3">The reward of feeding the poor is immense, and the Quran tells us that the righteous give food, out of love for Him, to the poor and the orphan and the captive, [saying] We feed you, for Allahs pleasure only â€” We desire from you neither reward nor thanks. [76:5-12].</p>
            <p className="text-base text-center py-3">Supporting hunger relief not only provides us with the reward of feeding the poor, but its also a beautiful way to gain Allahs (SWT) satisfaction.</p>
